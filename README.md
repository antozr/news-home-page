## My process

I'm starting by make the header with logo & navbar, I'm start integration with the mobil first for a easier progressing to the pc screen. I'm create the hamburger menu with differently animation for open and close.

After I've create the first section, for this I've placed the flex-wrap with the different size of compenents and the gap, I don't touch for the responsive, is good with screen width + 600px.
I've had the small transition with element in hover, for the attractivity and create the good project. 

For my facility I use the :root{} systeme in SCSS/CSS for add my color, and in the main file, I've reboot the style. 

Thank's. ðŸ¤™
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS ( scss ) for implement the BEM method 
- Flexbox
- Root systemes for simplify 
- Mobile-first workflow
- Parcel CLI for make the small "Webpack server "
- Javascript vanilla 

### What I learned

I'm learn the animation in css, with the keyframes, for create a reactive animation in parents & childrens elements. It's not simple -, but the result is good.

I'm test a new take to make a responsive navbar, and modify in js.
